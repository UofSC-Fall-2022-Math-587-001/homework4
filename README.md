## Homework 3: Due 2022.09.12 

This week we have a written part and an implementation part. 

### Written part 

Answer the questions found in `main.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them 
back here before midnight on the due date. You may do this as many times as 
you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf. 

(Hint: an adapted solution to the implementation could help you answer some
